# Discord Archive

An archive of Discord JS files since the move to RSPack. This stores a few files, mainly the main bundler (which houses most of the strings), constants1 (which stores all of the endpoints and routes), as well as stuff like message types, status types, etc. and constants2 (this stores a few things like gateway OP codes).
